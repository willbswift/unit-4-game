# Unit-4-Game

This is the ReadMe file for my “Lightsabre Construction Game.”  It was the assignment for the 4th week at Web Developer Bootcamp.  The idea was to make a themed number guessing/matching game using JavaScript and Jquery.  I chose a Lightsabre theme as the demo was a crystal game and building a lightsabre was the only interesting thing I could think of that requires several crystals to create.  

The game has built in instructions and is designed to be very simple for the player to play.  I made sure to include kyber crystals from several famous planets in the Star Wars Galaxy and added sound effect and some pics and a gif.  Also lots of Star Wars quotes from the films and other stories.  

To play simply load the html file on your browser of choice.  Here’s the link...

Use your mouse to select the crystals, and try to match your midi-chlorian count.
