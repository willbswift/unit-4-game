# Word-Guess-Game

This is the ReadMe file for my “Terminator: Hangman” game.  It was the assignment for the 3rd week at Web Developer Bootcamp.  The idea was to make a themed Hangman game using JavaScript.  I chose Terminator as technology has been kicking my but in this class.  

The game has built in instructions and is designed to be very simple for the player to play.  It should provide some entertainment to fans of the Terminator franchise.  I made sure to include names from all the Terminator films and the TV series.  So the bigger the fan you are the more entertaining the experience should be.  

To play simply load the html file on your browser of choice.  Here’s the link...
